# How to use

Simply make as many text files as you want in /texts/ and then link them in OBS (for each text file, tick "read from file" and select the corresponding text file). From then, you will never need to open each text file individually in OBS to edit texts. This is especially useful for text files that need to be edited frequently such as scores or player names for tournament organizers.
